### **RecipeGen: Personalized AI-Powered Recipe Recommendation System**

**RecipeGen** is an intelligent, AI-driven recipe recommendation system designed to help users discover recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. This project combines machine learning, web development, and cloud infrastructure to deliver a seamless experience for users looking for personalized culinary suggestions.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Recipe Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to recommend recipes based on user-inputted ingredients.
- **Real-Time Search & Filters**: Users can search, filter, and browse through a vast collection of recipes tailored to their tastes and dietary preferences.
- **Background Tasks**: Implements **Celery** for asynchronous task management, including periodic retraining of the prediction model for improved accuracy.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Built using **Django** for the backend, **Next.js** for the frontend, and **MongoDB** for the database. **Docker** and **Kubernetes** ensure scalable deployment.
- **Cloud-Ready**: Deployed with cloud-native technologies like **Redis**, **RabbitMQ**, and **Celery** to handle background processing efficiently.

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React-based framework)
- **Backend**: Django with Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Machine Learning**: Custom prediction model built with scikit-learn or similar libraries
- **Asynchronous Tasks**: Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ as the message broker
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes for scalable deployment
- **Version Control**: GitHub for code management

#### **How It Works:**
1. **User Interaction**: The user inputs available ingredients into the frontend (Next.js).
2. **Prediction Model**: The backend (Django) processes the input and uses a trained machine learning model to predict possible recipes.
3. **Recipe Display**: The recipes are returned to the frontend and displayed with relevant details like ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutritional information.
4. **Background Tasks**: Long-running tasks, like retraining the model or processing large datasets, are handled by Celery in the background, ensuring smooth user experience.

#### **Installation & Setup:**
- Clone the repository
- Set up Docker and Docker Compose for local development
- Configure MongoDB, Redis, and Celery
- Follow the deployment instructions to run the application on your cloud provider

This project demonstrates the power of combining machine learning with modern web development and cloud infrastructure to create a dynamic, scalable application.
